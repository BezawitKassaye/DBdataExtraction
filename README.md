# DBdataExtraction
In this project, We will extract information from Chinook.db using Python and SQL, and present the information on graphs using Python graph modules. 
Purposes of this project:
1) See artists' sales graph, sorted by revenue or country.
2) Filter top selling tracks(as many tracks as requested).
3) Filter top selling albums(as many albums as requested).

To code along:
  1) Set up your Replit.
  2) create a python Repl.
  3) Download the Chinook database from Git Hub and upload it on the Python Repl that you just created.
  4) Connect the database to Python, and start coding. Check out(https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html).
     
To see the nature of Chinook.db:
  1) Create an SQLite Repl.
  2) Upload Choonk.db.
  3) Create an SQLite file and name it sch.sql.
  4) Write ".table" and ".schema" in sch.sql.
  5) Paste the following code on main.sql.
     .open Chinook.db
     .mode box
     .headers on 
     .read sch.sql
  6) Hit the run button. 
  

I will test my code on Replite.com and post all my up-to-date code on my Github repository (DBdataExtraction).
